# SVG Walkthrough

SVG (scalable vector graphics) is the image format most commonly used on the web. It is an open standard developed by the World Wide Web Consortium. 

## Vector Images vs. Raster Images

Vector:

A raster image is just pixels at a fixed size. They are not very scalable and zooming in or out makes that obvious!

A vector image is numerical data drawn by your applications into fixed shapes that scale automatically. If you zoom in on a vector image it still looks sharp, and same if you zoom out.

The vast majority of websites use vector graphics for their logos. Some don't, like this website: https://chi-matic.com/

Your application looks more professional with a scalable logo.

## Let's Check it Out!

mkdir vector

cd vector

touch vector.html

Set up your HTML boilerplate and add an image tag to the body.

Go to a Wikipedia page for a company you know. Click on their logo, usually on the top right of the page. Click on the download icon, and then View in Browser. Copy the link that comes up and insert it into the image tag.

Give the image a style of "width: 100vh;"

<img width="1024" alt="Screenshot 2023-01-21 at 12 38 38 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102549585/213845384-d1d05a22-98a9-46a8-8dba-dcbddabd1d3d.png">

Note: 100vh means that it will take up 100% of the viewport.

Now, constantly change the size of your browser window. What happens to the quality of the image?

## Best Practice

A lot of buttons on the web are not vector images, they're just text. Some common examples include:

Hamburger Menu: ☰

Airplane Mode: ✈

Play Button: ▶

Back Button: ↩

The font may change how these are interpreted - it could come through as just a black graphic and it might also come through as an emoji. If you copy these here they will always copy to your clipboard as the former.

Use text when it's available! Text is scalable. When you want a more complicated logo, you have to use a vector image.
